The project “Sentiment E-commerce Insights Analysis for Reviews on Women’s Clothing” provides the growing importance of online reviews in shaping consumer choices, especially within the domain of women's clothing e-commerce, underscores the necessity for an advanced sentiment analysis system. As online shopping experiences exponential growth, customer reviews assume a pivotal role in influencing purchasing decisions. The categorization of reviews into five distinct sentiment polarities (strong negative, weak negative, neutral, weak positive, and strong positive) emerges as a crucial aspect in understanding and responding to consumer sentiments effectively. Highlight shortcomings: Current solutions often fall short of capturing the nuanced sentiments expressed in reviews, hindering companies from fully understanding customer perceptions.
The project aims to develop a sentiment analysis designed for E-commerce reviews pertaining to women's clothing. The primary objective is to create a multi-class classifier that accurately classifies sentiments into five polarities. Then, by utilizing machine learning techniques, we seek to amplify customer insights, streamline product evaluations, and support market analysis. Our approach involves bridging the gap between traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. This entails analyzing both review text and titles, identifying specific positive and negative terms, and constructing a sentiment lexicon to enhance the precision of our classification process.
